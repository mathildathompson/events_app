<!-- @rss_event = some shit from the model. could i just grab it straight from feed for now? yep maybe



<ul>
    <% @rss_event.each do |event| %>
    <!-- gets the array of events -->

        <% event.each do |sub_event| %>
          <!-- # starts to iterate through each sub-event in the event array  -->  

        <li><%= event.title%></li>
        
        <% end %>

    <% end %>
</ul>
